# Event TBD

## Problem Description:

Modern day's fast-paced and socially dispersed world makes it difficult for people to meet others and participate in activities that suit their interests. People frequently find it challenging to locate events whether it be business conferences, social get-togethers, or leisure pursuits.

## Proposed Solution:

We want to introduce an app for event organizers and attendees that makes it simple for people to discover different events (including but not limited to parties, conferences, and social gathers) according to their preferences. Users will be able to: 

1. **See event data** such as the location of the event, a real-time heat map of participants that are attending, event descriptions, and number of participants.
2. **RSVP** through our app feature which allows them to indicate their involvement with just a click of a button.
3. **Communicate with other attendees or the host** through the app with our messaging features. 
4. **Personalized event recommendations** to help users seek other events that matches their interests and encourage users to participate in more events.
5. **Host events** where users can host their own events in their area to meet other liked-minded individuals.

## Why This Matters

There are existing solutions for this problem, but they are scattered across multiple platforms, don't have enough user engagement elements, or don't offer enough changes for social interaction prior to, during, and following the event. It doesn't give the users the opportunity for networking, social fulfillment, and personal growth. By providing these features, the app will encourage users to participate in activities that align with their interests or professional goals, which will enhance their social experiences and expand their personal and professional networks. It will also help users make connections, friendships, and networking opportunities.
